Todo / bugs: 

Remove overuse of global variables.
------------------------------------
i got comments on the overuse of global variabels in my code. So i need to learn the how and why of that 
coding practise.


make an installer / packaging
------------------------------------
install it in de default program file folders of the respective os's.
include the todo.txt and the info.txt in the installation.

proper licencing files
------------------------------------
gnu v2? or how its called?


implement propper error handeling.
------------------------------------
If you enter a decimal number in the menu it flips like a mandman. (no clue why that happens, must find that out)

Also letters and special chars can be enterd. This should not be allowed.

And surely i forgot more cases for error andeling but these are the ones i found out on my own.


Localisation:
------------------------------------
I want to add some kind of localisation system via crowdin. 
Its an ambitous implementation but i want to see/know if im able to implement it.

Cross platform:
------------------------------------
For not is a terminal app only and uses a windows system function making it only wrking properly on windows. For now it perhaps works on mac and linux but i cant guarantee anything.

Gui
------------------------------------
Eventualy i want to add a gui.
I want to design it in qt5 and add it to the project.


Treading or how its called?
------------------------------------
not sure what this is but i have to do research on it. 
I think its to make different funtions run in their own treads making it faster. 
I guess its also tied to optimalisation but for now im quite far before im going to dig into this.


Optimalisation
------------------------------------
This will be for much later when i learn al the previous stuff. And i suspect that when i learn more in the future that i will update my code accordingly.
